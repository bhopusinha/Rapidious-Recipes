2. **Filter Recipes**:
 - Rating: High-rated recipes
 - Diet: Vegetarian or non-vegetarian recipes 
 -  Nutritional Content: High protein or low-fat recipes

 3. **Pagination**:
   The results are paginated for easy navigation through a large number of recipes.
 
 4. **Responsive ui**:
 The interface is responsive and inspired by e-commerce platforms like Flipkart or Amazon.

 ### Api Endpoints:
 The backend provides several API endpoints to interact with the recipe data stored in OpenSearch.

 1. **Search recipes** 
 - GET /search?q=<search_query>&page=<page_number>&limit=<limit>
 - Description: Retrieves recipes based on the search query and supports pagination.

 2. **Filter recipes** 
 - GET /filter?minProtein=<min_value>&maxFat=<max_value>&rating=<rating>&veg=<true_or_false>
 - Description: Filters recipes based on criteria such as minimum protein, maximum fat, rating, and whether it’s vegetarian
